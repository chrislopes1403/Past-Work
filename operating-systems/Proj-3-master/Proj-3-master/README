MakeFile
===================================== MAKEFILE DESCRIPTION ======================================
Once proper files are downloaded, "make" can be typed to compile the source code into a usable
executable. No bugs have been found during compilation or linking, so there should be no issues
with this step. If one wishes to remove all executables and run a clean compilation, "make clean"
can be utilized.
================================= KNOWN BUGS/UNFINISHED PORTIONS ================================
